## Instagram Picture UI
This repository contains an HTML file that displays the User Interface implemented by Instagram to allow users to like pictures. This project was developed using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. 

## Installation
This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install the application. Simply open the HTML file to use it. If you would like to fork the design, make sure you have a SASS Compiler installed in your Microsoft Visual Studio Code app to convert the SCSS file to CSS. Without the compiler, the SCSS version would not render any stylish changes to the HTML file. 

Also, you will need to click on the heart emoji in order for the JavaScript function to work in the similar format as Instagram's.
